1. Differences between at, cron, and anacron:

'at' is a command for a specified time, but only once. It's generally only used for 1 time tasks.

'cron' is a command for repeated tasks at specific times and dates. It's ideal for refular tasks like daily backups.

'anacron' is soooort of like cron, but desifned foe systems that don't run continuously. Anacron can run missed tasks once the system is up. 

2. Differences between crontab -e, and vi /etc/crontab

'crontab -e' edits the crontab file for the current user, allowing them to schedule tasks that will run under their user account. 

'vi /etc/crontab' edits the systems crontab file. the system's crontab file schedules tasks to run as root or any specified user. This requires administrative priviledges.
